## Overview

This document is your step-by-step guide to completing the Capstone Project: a fully functional weather dashboard built in Python. You will work individually on your app, and later contribute to a team-based collaborative feature. Follow the weekly instructions to stay on track and submit a project you can be proud of.

## Week 11: Project Launch & Planning

**Goal:** Understand the project scope, select features, and plan your development path.

- Attend capstone kickoff  
- Review the full feature menu  
- Choose 3 features from the list (⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐)  
- Choose 1 enhancement (personality, visual flair, etc.)  
- Sketch your app structure (Tkinter windows, file layout, etc.)  
- Write a personal development timeline  

### 🧩 Feature Menu – Choose 3

#### ⭐ Basic Data Features

- **Weather History Tracker** – Save daily weather to a CSV file and display the last 7 days  
- **Simple Statistics** – Track min/max temperatures and count weather types  
- **City Comparison** – Compare current weather in two cities side-by-side  

#### ⭐⭐ Visual Features

- **Temperature Graph** – Show a line graph of temperature over time using `matplotlib`  
- **Weather Icons** – Use canvas graphics to visually represent weather (e.g., sun, clouds)  
- **Theme Switcher** – Toggle between day/night modes or custom color themes  

#### ⭐⭐ Interactive Features

- **Weather Journal** – Add daily mood notes and save them to a text file  
- **Favorite Cities** – Let users save and quickly access preferred cities  
- **Weather Alerts** – Notify the user when temperature crosses a certain threshold  

#### ⭐⭐⭐ Smart Features

- **Tomorrow’s Guess** – Use simple logic to predict tomorrow’s temperature  
- **Trend Detection** – Show arrows or indicators for rising/falling weather trends  
- **Activity Suggester** – Suggest activities based on current weather (e.g., go biking, stay in)  

### ✨ Enhancement Options – Choose 1

- Mascot or Weather Personality  
- Achievement System  
- Custom Descriptions (instead of API defaults)  
- Sound Effects  
- Weather Poetry (haiku, etc.)  
- Creative Visuals (animations, emojis, styled graphics)  

✅ **Deliverables:** Feature selections, architecture plan, test cases draft

---

## Week 12: Build the Core Application

**Goal:** Create a basic but working weather app with GUI and API connection.

- Set up Tkinter window and layout  
- Connect to OpenWeatherMap API  
- Fetch weather data for a city  
- Display data (temperature, city name, description)  
- Add error handling and file saving (text or CSV)  

✅ **Milestone:** Working core app with basic GUI and API integration

---

## Week 13: Build Feature #1

**Goal:** Implement your first feature and integrate it with the core app.

- Choose a feature from the menu (Data, Visual, or Interactive)  
- Use templates if needed  
- Connect this feature to your main GUI  

✅ **Deliverables:** Feature #1 functional and visible in app  

### Team Formation:

- Teams of 3–4 are announced  
- Choose a team name and a shared feature idea (e.g., Weather Battle)  
- Elect a Project Owner  

---

## Week 14: Build Feature #2 + Start Team Repo

**Goal:** Expand your individual app and prepare the team structure.

- Implement Feature #2  
- Polish UI and integrate it  
- Project Owner creates GitHub repo for team  
- Set up team folders:  
  - `team_feature/`  
  - `team_data/`  
  - `docs/`  
- Export your own weather data as JSON  
- Submit pull request to team repo  

✅ **Deliverables:** Feature #2 working, data exported to team repo  

---

## Week 15: Build Feature #3 + Begin Team Feature

**Goal:** Complete your last solo feature and begin contributing to the team feature.

- Implement Feature #3  
- Refactor and organize your app  
- Begin work on your assigned team task  
- Collaborate via GitHub branches and pull requests  

✅ **Milestone:** All 3 solo features complete, team feature under development

---

## Week 16: Enhancement + Documentation + Integration

**Goal:** Finalize your app, add personality, and ensure a smooth demo experience.

- Add your enhancement (mascot, theme switcher, sounds, etc.)  
- Write `README.md` and `user_guide.md`  
- Test integration with team feature (add a button to your app)  
- Practice opening the team feature from your GUI  
- Submit your full app folder + confirm your role in team repo  

✅ **Deliverables:** Final code, documentation, and working integration

---

## Week 17: Showcase Week

**Goal:** Present your work clearly and confidently.

- Demo your individual app (3–4 minutes)  
- Demo your team feature with your group (5–7 minutes)  
- Submit peer evaluations  
- Celebrate and take screenshots for your portfolio!  

✅ **Final Submission Checklist:**

- Individual App  
- 3 Features + Enhancement  
- Linked Team Feature  
- `README` + Docs  
- Peer Evaluation  
- Optional: Record Demo Video

## 📘 Notes

- If you get stuck, ask for help early  
- You can always opt out of team work with instructor approval  
- The app is yours — make it personal, useful, and fun
