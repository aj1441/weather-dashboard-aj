# Quick Setup Guide

## âœ… What We've Fixed:

1. **Custom Theme Integration**: Your `aj_darkly` theme is now properly integrated
2. **Theme Toggle Logic**: Fixed the backwards light/dark mode issue
3. **Default Theme**: Changed default from "darkly" to "aj_darkly"

## ðŸ”§ What You Need To Do:

### 1. Fix the API Key Warning
Replace this line in your `.env` file:
```
API_KEY=your_actual_32_character_api_key_here
```

With your real API key from OpenWeatherMap:
```
API_KEY=your_real_32_character_api_key
```

### 2. Test the Application
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### 3. Clean Up (Optional)
You can now delete the old theme file:
```bash
rm features/user.py
```

## ðŸŽ¨ How the Theme System Now Works:

- **Light Mode**: Uses "pulse" theme (clean, bright)
- **Dark Mode**: Uses your custom "aj_darkly" theme with your color scheme
- **Toggle**: â˜€ Light / ðŸŒ™ Dark button correctly switches between them
- **Persistence**: Your theme choice is saved and restored

## ðŸš€ Your Custom Theme Colors:
- Primary Blue: `#00bce9`
- Background: `#121212` (dark)
- Text: `#f5f5f5` (light)
- Accent: `#ccb9ec` (purple selection)

The theme system is now properly set up to use your custom dark theme!
